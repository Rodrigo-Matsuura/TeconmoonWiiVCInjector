This is a modernized, optimized, and polished fork of the classic **[piratesephiroth/TeconmoonWiiVCInjector](https://github.com/piratesephiroth/TeconmoonWiiVCInjector)**.

The original tool for injecting Wii and GameCube games into the Wii U Virtual Console has been completely refactored to eliminate years of technical debt, introduce ultra-fast in-memory caching, modernize network connectivity, and add native support for modern compressed image formats.

## 🛠 Features & Improvements in v4.0.0.0

Here is the detailed changelog and architectural refactoring breakdown of all changes implemented since the first commit of this fork up to the stable **v4.0.0.0** release:

### 📦 1. Out-of-the-Box NKIT & NASOS Support
* **Compressed Formats**: Added full native support for reading and converting compressed images in `.nkit.iso` and `.iso.dec` / `.dec` formats, saving users the trouble of manually decompressing images beforehand.

### ⚡ 2. Drastic Database Performance Caching (wiitdb)
* **Instant `O(1)` Lookups**: Completely refactored the database query engine in `GameTdb.cs`. The dictionary database `wiitdb.txt` (334 KB) is now read and parsed **exactly once** in a thread-safe static constructor.
* **In-Memory Cache**: Game name and ID queries now utilize static in-memory `Dictionary` lookups, replacing the slow, sequential, line-by-line disk I/O reads (`O(N)`).

### 🌐 3. High-Performance Network Stack (`HttpClient`)
* **Deprecating Legacy WebClient/HttpWebRequest**: Modernized all network interactions across the codebase by completely removing obsolete classes.
* **Singleton HttpClient**: Introduced a single, static, reusable `HttpClient` instance (`Program.Client`) shared globally. This prevents socket exhaustion, optimizes connection pooling, and significantly accelerates download speeds for game banners (Cucholix's Repo) and Nintendont files.
* **Lightweight Connection Checks**: Centralized internet verification to perform lightweight `HEAD` requests (`HttpMethod.Head`) instead of full downloads, resulting in an instant app startup.

### 🔒 4. Enhanced Portability & Security (No Admin Required)
* **Registry-Free Key Storage**: Migrated critical Wii U cryptography keys (Common Key, Title Key, and Ancast Key) from the global Windows Registry to the application's internal **User Settings (`Settings`)**.
* **Zero Elevation Required**: The program now runs flawlessly without requiring "Run as Administrator" privileges, making it significantly safer and fully portable.

### 🧼 5. Clean Codebase & Warning-Free Build
* **0 Warnings, 0 Errors**: Resolved all compilation warnings (including `CS0169` and `CS0414`). Removed more of the class-level variables and dead fields leftover from older iterations.
* **Decoupled Process Execution**: Refactored the external program launcher (`LaunchProgram`) to eliminate class-level global flags in favor of safe, parameter-based execution arguments.
* **Path Safety**: Converted manual path concatenations to robust `Path.Combine` calls, ensuring path safety and cross-platform compatibility.

### 🐧 6. Cross-Platform Compilation out of the Box
* **Linux/Mono Friendly**: Disabled ClickOnce manifest generation in the `.csproj` file, resolving a classic Mono/MSBuild bug that blocked direct Linux compilation. You can now build and package the `.exe` seamlessly on any operating system!

## 🚀 How to Build

### On Windows (Visual Studio)
1. Open the solution file `TeconMoon's WiiVC Injector.sln`.
2. Restore the NuGet packages.
3. Select the `Release` configuration and click **Build Solution**.

### On Linux (Mono / MSBuild)
Ensure you have the Mono development toolkit installed, then run the following in the repository root:
```bash
# To generate a Debug build
msbuild "TeconMoon's WiiVC Injector.sln" /t:Build /p:Configuration=Debug

# To generate the highly optimized Release build
msbuild "TeconMoon's WiiVC Injector.sln" /t:Build /p:Configuration=Release
```
